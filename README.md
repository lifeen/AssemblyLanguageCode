**ðŸ”§ Welcome to My World of Assembly Language ðŸ”§**
Are you ready to dive headfirst into the wild and wonderful world of assembly programming? Well, I've created this collection of resources to help you get started in the world of programming with assembly. Think of it as your guide to understanding how computers really work, with a few jokes thrown in to keep things fun.

**ðŸŽ‰ What's Inside? ðŸŽ‰**
Learning assembly language can be tricky, so some C programming knowledge is going to play a huge role. Think of it like needing to know letters before reading ancient Egyptian symbols. Check out my C resources (code and notes included) to prepare for this assembly adventure!

**ðŸ’¡ What's My Plan? ðŸ’¡**
I've documented my journey topically. Expect clear explanations about assembly from beginner to advanced!

**ðŸ¤– Why Assembly? ðŸ¤–**
Ever wondered how computers truly work? What if you could control them directly, like a skilled technician fine-tuning a complex machine? Assembly language lets you do just that! It's not easy, but with time you get the flow. Don't worry, even if it initially feels cryptic, we'll tackle it one line of code at a time, with explanations, and support along the way.  Am also learning this stuff, just wanted to simplify reading assembly for anyone who's interested. By the way I used cherrytree for these notes, and ms word for the others.

**Let's rock the assembly world together! ðŸš€**
